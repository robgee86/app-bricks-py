"""Compute the multi-level build plan for container images.

Containers live in ``containers/<group>/<name>/``. The group only documents
what a container is for: a release builds every container, and a container is
always identified by its leaf directory name, which is also its image name.

The dependency graph is declared in ``containers/*/*/ci.json`` via the
``downstream`` attribute (parent -> children edges). This module walks that
graph, resolves the full set of containers to (re)build for a given selection
and assigns each of them a topological level (build wave), so that a base image
is always built before the images that derive ``FROM`` it.

The result is emitted as ``level_<n>=<json-array>`` lines (plus
``all_containers=<json-array>``) that a GitHub Actions job can consume via
``$GITHUB_OUTPUT``. Each level is an independent matrix; levels run in sequence.
