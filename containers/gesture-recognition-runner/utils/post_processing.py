def decode_preds_from_anchors(box_coords: np.ndarray, img_size: Tuple[int, int], anchors: np.ndarray) -> None:
    """
    Decode predictions using the provided anchors.

    Notes
    -----
    - Operates in-place on `box_coords`.
    - Supports additional coordinates (e.g., keypoints) beyond the first 2 rows:
        - row 0: (x_center, y_center)
        - row 1: (w, h)
        - rows 2+: interpreted as keypoints ... each entry is (x, y)
    - Ranges expected to be normalized (0..1) before scaling by anchors and image size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    box_coords : np.ndarray
        Shape [..., K, 2] where the last dim is (x, y) and K >= 2.
        Convention for the first two rows:
            box_coords[..., 0, :] = (x_center, y_center)
            box_coords[..., 1, :] = (w, h)
        Any rows from index 2 onward are treated as keypoints and decoded similarly.
        This array is updated in place.

    img_size : (int, int)
        (width, height) of the network input (NOT original image size).
        The order matches how coordinates are treated.

    anchors : np.ndarray
        Same leading shape as `box_coords` except the middle K must match for at least
        the first two rows; typically the same K. Expected shape [..., K, 2] where:
            anchors[..., 0, :] = (x_center, y_center)
            anchors[..., 1, :] = (w, h)
        Values are in the same normalized space used by `box_coords` before decoding.
