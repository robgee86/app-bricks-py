"""Configure llama.cpp for the models installed in a directory.

Writes the models.ini preset the server is started with, and answers the two questions
run-model-router.sh asks before starting it: which context size the installed models can
hold (``--print-ctx``), and how many Hexagon sessions they need at that context
(``--print-ndev``). Those two modes print a single number on stdout and send every
diagnostic to stderr, so the caller can read the answer with a command substitution.
``--probe-ggml-types`` is internal: the script runs itself in that mode to read the ggml
type table out of libggml in a child process (see probe_ggml_types()).

Usage:
    python configure-llamacpp.py /models
    python configure-llamacpp.py /models --print-ctx --ctx 16384
    python configure-llamacpp.py /models --print-ndev --ctx 4096

# weights of its layers, the slice of the KV cache that belongs to them, its own compute
# buffer and, from two sessions up, a copy of the compute buffer of the session it takes
# its input from. Sizing it is a matter of keeping the busiest session under the DSP
# address space the backend reports for one — see ../SESSION_ALLOCATION.md. Past that the
# load fails on the chunk that no longer maps:
#
#   ggml-hex: HTP0 buffer mapping failed : domain_id 3 size ... error 0x00000001
#   alloc_tensor_range: failed to allocate HTP0 buffer of size ...
#
# Before resizing anything over such a failure, check the board's free RAM: the DSP
# buffers come from plain system memory (/dev/dma_heap/system), so the same message
# also appears when the board is simply out of it. Measured: a loaded model
# costs about 1.6x its GGUF size in RAM.
