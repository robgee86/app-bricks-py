"""Write/read the per-model ".arduino_metadata.yaml" record of a completed download.

The downloaders receive their whole input as lowercase environment variables, taken
from ``deployment.platforms.<board>.variables`` in models-list.yaml, and the
in-progress ``.download`` marker is deleted once the download succeeds — so without
this file nothing on disk would record *what* was downloaded. It is written inside
the model directory after a successful download and stays there:

    models:                     # one record per installed download
      - downloaded_at: '2026-08-03T09:41:12Z'
        handler: hf-handler
        model_id: llamacpp:gemma-4-E2B_q4_0-it
        model_origin: built_in
        files:                  # what this download fetched, relative to the directory
          - gemma-4-E2B_q4_0-it.gguf
        inputs:                 # the download variables, verbatim from the environment
          models_repository: llamacpp
          model_directory: google/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-q4_0-gguf
          model_url: https://huggingface.co/google/...

The document is the ``models`` list and nothing else, for every handler. One whose
directory holds a single model (AI Hub, Edge Impulse) writes exactly one record and
replaces it wholesale on the next download; the Hugging Face handler downloads every
quantization of a repository into the same directory, so each download appends its
own record there, and ``files`` says which files it stands for (see the last bullet).

Contracts callers must honour:

- ``write_metadata`` never raises: a write error is reported as an ``info`` event and
  the function returns None. Whether that fails the download is the caller's decision,
  and the two kinds of handler decide it differently:

  * The Hugging Face handler treats None as **fatal** — it keeps the ".download"
    marker (so the next run discards and retries) and exits non-zero. This reverses
    the original "bookkeeping must never fail a completed multi-GB transfer" stance,
    deliberately: an ad-hoc model is deleted through the API by the ``inputs``
    recorded here, so an installed-but-unrecorded ad-hoc model would be permanently
    unmanageable, while a lost transfer can simply be repeated. The reversal happened
    before ad-hoc models went GA, which is what makes the next bullet possible.
  * The AI Hub and Edge Impulse handlers keep it best-effort: their models are all
    declared in models-list.yaml, so the host can always manage them from the
    declaration alone and the record only feeds outdated-detection.

- For **readers** the file stays optional — installs made before it existed, or by a
  best-effort handler, have none, and its absence means "unknown / legacy install",
  never "up to date". But every ad-hoc model installed by a current downloader is
  guaranteed to carry one.
- ``model_origin`` says where the model comes from, not where its id was read from:
  ``built_in`` for a model models-list.yaml declares, ``user`` for one
  downloaded ad hoc. Any Hugging Face repository can be fetched by putting its URL or
  compact key in ``model_url`` with no entry in the list, so ``user`` is a
  **normal, supported state, not an error**. Only that outdated-detection does not
  apply to it: there is no declaration to compare against. The listing reports the
  same field with the same two values.
- ``model_id`` is always set for a model that downloaded successfully, curated or not.
  A user-configured model has no entry key to borrow, so the handler supplies a
  ``fallback_model_id`` derived from what it fetched, matching the id the listing
  reports for the same files (``common/gguf_naming.py``). That id is a snapshot: if
  the model is later added to the curated catalog its listing name changes to the
  entry's stem-form id and the recorded one goes stale. The listing, derived from
  the filesystem and the catalog, is the authority.
- Nothing else is copied out of models-list.yaml. ``model_id`` points back at the
  entry, and every other field of it (name, description, source, model_size_mb, ...)
  is read from models-list.yaml itself rather than duplicated — and left to go stale —
  here. The record holds only what models-list.yaml cannot tell you: which variables
  this install was actually downloaded with, and when.
- The Hugging Face handler downloads into a per-*repository* directory, so several
  downloads — one per quantization — share one metadata file: the ``models`` list
  above, where every download appends its own record instead of overwriting the
  previous one. Readers pick the right record with ``record_for_file`` (by the file a
  listing entry stands for) or ``record_for_model_id`` (by the entry a curated model
  matches), and a delete drops the records of the files it removed with
  ``prune_metadata_records``. Only this file is shared — whether a model is installed,
  and what an interrupted download discards, are decided per quantization, and the
  ``.download`` marker says which files it stands for.
