    A platform matches when every variable it declares is present in *env* with an

    arrive in the environment as ``"948887"``. Extra environment keys are ignored,
    which is what makes the match work at all (the container also sees PATH, HOME,
    ...). Keep ``version`` values quoted in models-list.yaml: an unquoted ``0.51``
    would be parsed as a float and stringify to ``"0.51"``.

    Entries deployed as ``pre-loaded`` have no ``platforms`` and are skipped, as
    are platforms declaring no variables (an empty map matches every environment).

    Args:
        models: The list of entries returned by ``load_models_list``.
        env: Mapping of environment variables (values are strings).
        board: Optional board name, used to pick between platforms of the same entry.

    Returns:
        ``(model_id, model_data, platform_name)``, or ``(None, None, None)`` when
        nothing matches or several different models match equally well.
