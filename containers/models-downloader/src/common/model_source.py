"""The runtime that runs a listed model and the publisher that distributes it.

Both are reported by the listing as ``runtime`` and ``model_publisher``, and both are
derived from what the handler downloads rather than declared for every entry:

- ``runtime`` follows the handler alone: every AI Hub model runs on QNN, every Edge
  Impulse model is an ``.eim`` built on the Edge Impulse SDK, whatever the target it was
  built for, and every Hugging Face model is a GGUF served by llama.cpp.
- ``model_publisher`` is who publishes the downloaded artifact, not who authored the
  underlying model: Qualcomm AI Hub for AI Hub, Edge Impulse for Edge Impulse, and the
  repository owner for Hugging Face ("unsloth" for "unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF"), kept
  in the owner's own case. A models-list.yaml entry overrides it with
  ``metadata.model_publisher`` — an Edge Impulse project built on an AI Hub model is
  published as ``qualcomm-ai-hub``. A canonical Hugging Face repository has no owner,
  and its publisher is None.
