hf_downloader — Hugging Face Model Downloader CLI

A command-line tool for downloading GGUF-format models from Hugging Face
repositories. It targets llama.cpp-style repos that may contain multiple
quantization variants and optional multimodal projection (mmproj) files.
After downloading, it auto-generates a ``models.ini`` configuration file
that indexes all downloaded models for use by downstream runners.

Usage — one input, two syntaxes
------------------------------
``--model-url`` is the only way to name a model, and it accepts either form, so the
host has a single variable to set whatever the model is::

    # 1. File URL: downloads that exact file at that exact commit (reproducible).
    hf_downloader --model-url https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/blob/<revision>/<file>.gguf

    # 2. Compact key, as llama.cpp's "-hf": downloads whatever matches the
    #    quantization, at the tip of the default branch. model_type is optional, and
    #    so is the quantization — a bare repository defaults to Q4_0, falling back
    #    through Q8_0, IQ4_NL, Q4_K_M and Q4_K_S when the repository has no Q4_0.
    #    Boards listed in BOARD_QUANTIZATIONS have their own order, which may depend on
    #    the size the repository name advertises: UnoQ takes Q8_0 first up to 1B
    #    parameters and Q4_0 first above that, keeps IQ4_NL as its last resort, and
    #    never falls back to a K quant.
    hf_downloader --model-url [<model_type>:]<repo_id>[:<quantization>[:<mmproj_quantization>]]

The multimodal projector takes either syntax too, in its own variable, whichever form the
model came in — and only there can it be asked for without naming a quantization, which
falls back through F16 and BF16::

    hf_downloader --model-url <model> --model-mmproj-url https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/blob/<revision>/mmproj-<q>.gguf
    hf_downloader --model-url <model> --model-mmproj-url [<model_type>:]<repo_id>[:<quantization>]

A leading ``<scheme>://`` selects form 1; anything else is parsed as a key. A URL that
names only a repository — the address of the page the file would be copied from — says
what a bare key says, and is read as that key rather than refused.
The quantization field also accepts a full file name or an explicit glob, so a single
file can be pinned by name without a URL. When nothing in the repository matches, the
error lists the GGUF files that are there.

Only a defaulted quantization falls back. One that was asked for is downloaded or not at
all: a caller who named Q3_K_S wants that file, and quietly handing them a different one
would be a worse answer than the error listing what the repository does publish.

What is accepted
----------------
``model_url`` is host configuration: whoever installs an app can point it anywhere, so it
is validated in two steps instead of being taken at face value.

Form 1 must be a canonical Hugging Face model file URL and nothing else — host
huggingface.co with no userinfo or port, path
``/<owner>/<repo>/{resolve,blob}/<revision>/<file>.gguf``, names the Hub could have issued,
and a repo-relative ``.gguf`` path that cannot climb out of the output directory
(``parse_hf_url``). Form 2 gets the same check on its repository id, which also becomes a
directory under the models mount.

Then the Hub is asked what the target actually is (``validate_hub_source``): the repository
must exist and be readable *anonymously* — a private or gated repository is refused, and a
token found in the environment cannot change that — and a URL, which pins one exact file at
one exact commit, must name a file that is really in the repository. Only ``--hf-token``,
which the operator has to pass explicitly, opens gated and private repositories. ``--check``
and ``--delete`` skip this step: they only read the filesystem and stay usable offline.

Key options
-----------
--output-dir DIR        Destination directory (default: current directory).
                        Files are saved under ``<output-dir>/<repo-id>/``.
--hf-token KEY          Hugging Face API token. Without it only public, non-gated
                        repositories can be downloaded.
--verbose               Print resolved parameters before downloading.

Where the files land
--------------------
Everything is downloaded into ``<output-dir>/<repo-id>/``, so the quantizations of one
repository share a directory and coexist there. Only the files a request actually names
decide whether it is already installed: a ``Q4_0`` on disk does not make ``Q3_K_S``
present, and asking for the second one downloads it next to the first instead of
reporting the repository as complete. The cleanup paths honour the same rule — an
interrupted or failed download only discards the files it was fetching, never a sibling
quantization that finished earlier. The shared ".arduino_metadata.yaml" follows suit:
every download appends its own record (naming the files it fetched), and a delete drops
only the records of the files it removed, so no quantization is ever described by
another one's record.

After all files are downloaded, ``models.ini`` is written to ``<output-dir>``
mapping each model name to its GGUF path (and mmproj path where present); names
follow ``common/gguf_naming.py`` — the file stem for models the curated catalog
declares, the output-dir-relative path for ad-hoc downloads.
