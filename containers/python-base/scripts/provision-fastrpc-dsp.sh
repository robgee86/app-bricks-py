# Builds a merged /usr/share/hexagon-dsp view in the container layer: DSP
# payload dirs are symlinked from the host mount, conf.d holds copies of the
# host yamls (the fastrpc parser only lists regular files) plus the image's
# baked default. Nothing is ever written back to the host mount.
#
# Same idea as qairt-entrypoint.sh, but for the Debian libfastrpc1 this image
# installs: that build reads its config from /usr/share/hexagon-dsp/conf.d and
# resolves each DSP_LIBRARY_PATH relative to /usr/share/hexagon-dsp (the QAIRT
# source build uses /usr/share/qcom for both).
#
# Installed at /provision-fastrpc-dsp.sh; derived images call it from their
# entrypoint (python-apps-base does it in run.sh).

# The merged view must stay readable and traversable by every uid, whichever
# user runs the app: force dirs to 755 and copies to 644 regardless of the
# inherited umask.
