"""Names for the GGUF models of the llamacpp tree, decided by their download records.

Different Hugging Face repositories can publish identically named GGUF files, so an
ad-hoc download cannot be named after its file alone: two separate downloads would
share one name — one listing id, one models.ini section — and delete, status and size
would all act on whichever file happened to win.

``gguf_model_name`` names a file by its ".arduino_metadata.yaml" download record:

- A **user-configured** model (its record says ``model_origin: user``) is
  named by its tree-relative path without the extension, which carries the repository
  (e.g. "unsloth/SmolLM2-GGUF/SmolLM2-Q4_K_M"). The name is unique by construction
  and stable for the whole life of the install — it never changes when a same-named
  file is downloaded from another repository, and an impostor named like a curated
  model can never answer to the curated name.
- Everything else keeps the file stem: a **curated** download (``built_in`` record,
  whose fixed ``llamacpp:<stem>`` id models-list.yaml declares and installed apps
  reference), and a file with **no record at all** — an out-of-the-box model, since
  records only exist for downloaded models. That fallback is what names the models
  flashed onto a board before any download ran; the scan that regenerates models.ini
  backfills their records from the catalog afterwards (see hf_downloader).

The same rule must name a model everywhere it appears: the listing id
(``llamacpp:<name>``), the models.ini section (``<name>``) and the fallback metadata
id. The LLM brick resolves ``llamacpp:<name>`` to the model llama-server serves under
the section ``<name>``, so these may never drift apart. The runners' standalone
configure-llamacpp.py scripts replicate this record-based naming (they carry no
catalog at all); keep them in sync.

The catalog declarations below no longer name installed files; they still say which
locations the curated entries expect, which is what matches a found file to its
models-list.yaml entry in the listing, names a pending download before its record
exists, and tells the models.ini scan which recordless files are out-of-the-box
models to backfill.
