"""Read/write the per-model ".download" in-progress marker.

The marker lives at ``<model_dir>/.download`` and exists only while a download is
in progress (or was interrupted before completing). It is a JSON document so
external tools can match the in-progress model back to models-list.yaml:

    {
      "status": "downloading",
      "handler": "hf-handler",
      "models_repository": "llamacpp",
      "model_directory": "google/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-q4_0-gguf",
      "file_patterns": ["*Q4_0*.gguf"]
    }

``file_patterns`` names the files being downloaded, and matters when the directory can
hold more than one model: a Hugging Face repository directory is shared by every
quantization ever downloaded from that repository, so the bare presence of a marker there
does not mean that all of them are in progress. It is optional — a handler whose model
directory holds exactly one model has nothing to disambiguate, and a marker written
before the field existed carries none — and its absence means the whole directory.

``size_mb`` is the size the download will have once complete (``common/model_size.py``),
written when the handler knows it up front. The listing reports it for a download in
progress that models-list.yaml does not size — an ad-hoc Hugging Face model — so such a
model is sized before any of its files exist. It is optional as well.
