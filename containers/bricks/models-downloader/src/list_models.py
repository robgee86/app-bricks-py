"""List all models and their presence on the filesystem.

Reads models-list.yaml and checks whether each model with a deployment
section is present under /models (or a custom base path). GGUF models found under
/models/llamacpp that no entry declares are listed too, since any Hugging Face
repository can be downloaded ad hoc; ``model_origin`` says which of the two a listed
model is ("built_in" or "user").

# "size_mb" is on every entry, in the unit and rounding of common/model_size.py: what
# the files measure on disk once the model is installed, the size models-list.yaml

# nothing declares, the size its ".download" marker says it will have. It is null only
# when none of these is known. "model_size_mb" (declared) and "disk_size_mb" (measured,
