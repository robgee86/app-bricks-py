# Arduino Apps Brick Library

The library is composed of configurable and reusable 'Bricks', based on optional infrastructure (executed via Docker Compose) and wrapping Python® code (to simplify code usage).

## What is a Brick?

A **Brick** is a modular, reusable building block that provides specific functionality for Arduino applications. Each Brick is self-contained with standardized configuration, consistent APIs, and optional Docker service definitions.

## Directory Structure

Every Brick must follow this standardized directory structure:

```
src/arduino/app_bricks/brick_name/
├── __init__.py                 # Required: Public API exports
├── brick_config.yaml          # Required: Brick metadata
├── brick_compose.yaml         # Optional: Docker services
├── README.md                  # Required: Documentation
├── [implementation_files.py]  # Brick logic
└── [assets]                   # Static resources
```

Brick usage examples live in the [app-bricks-examples](https://github.com/arduino/app-bricks-examples) repository, under the `bricks/` folder.

## Configuration variables

| Variable  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| APP_HOME  | Base application directory context  |
| LOCAL_DEV | To switch logic for local library development |
| APPSLAB_VERSION | To override the image versions referenced in brick_compose.yaml files |

## Library compile and build 

To build the wheel file suitable for release, run:
```sh
task build
```
To build the package as a snapshot for the latest development build, run:
```sh
task build-dev
```

## Library development steps
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and the [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) CLI tool, clone the repository and run:

```sh
task init
```

uv provides Python 3.13, creates `.venv` and installs the library with its development dependencies, exactly the versions pinned in `uv.lock`. Every task runs inside that environment through `uv run`, there is nothing to activate.

To force a specific Arduino App Lab container version, use 'APPSLAB_VERSION' environment variable.

## Linting and formatting

To improve the development experience in VS Code, we recommend adding a `.vscode` folder to the repository root containing the following JSON files:

- `extensions.json`

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "charliermarsh.ruff",
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github",
    "ms-python.python",
    "tamasfe.even-better-toml"
  ],
  "unwantedRecommendations": [
    "ms-python.pylint"
  ]
}
```

- `settings.json`

```json
{
    // Set the Python interpreter to the virtual environment
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv",
    "flake8.enabled": false,  // Disable flake8 since we use ruff
    "ruff.enable": true,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "tests"
    ],
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,

    // Linting and formatting settings on save
    "[python]": {
        // 1) use ruff as the default formatter
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        
        // 2) automatically format the code on save
        // comment this setting if you don't want to automatically format your code on save
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,

        // 3) apply secure linter fixes on save
        // comment this setting if you don't want to automatically fix with the linter your code on save
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
        }
    }
}
```

After adding those files, VS Code will suggest installing the Python and Ruff extensions, which are properly configured for this project.

Alternatively, you can use the Ruff CLI to safely auto-fix linting issues and format your code by running:

```sh
task lint
```

```sh
task fmt
```

## Testing

All tests must be added in tests/ folder. To execute tests, run command:
```sh
task test
```

or, to execute specific tests, use:
```sh
task test:arduino/app_bricks
```

Modules can use LOCAL_DEV=true env variable to set development specific configurations.

For development purposes, it is possible to point to development containers (instead of the released ones) using two variables:
```sh
export DOCKER_REGISTRY_BASE=ghcr.io/<githubuser>/
export DOCKER_PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE=app-bricks/python-apps-base:dev-pose-classification
```
Development containers are published by the dev CI (`docker-build.yml`) tagged as `dev-<branch-name>` (e.g. branch `pose-classification` → tag `dev-pose-classification`).

## Examples alignment

The published examples live in [app-bricks-examples](https://github.com/arduino/app-bricks-examples). To check whether your changes break the API contract the examples rely on (pyright analyzes their Python sources against your checkout), clone that repository next to this one and run:

```sh
task check:examples-alignment:run
```

To list the bricks that have no examples yet:

```sh
task check:examples-alignment:coverage
```

See `scripts/check_examples_alignment.py --help` for the full options (custom paths, JSON output, PR base/head diff — the mode used by the `check-examples-alignment.yml` workflow).

## Release

Release is based on tags pushed to `main`. A single workflow (`docker-publish.yml`) handles all container
releases: **the tag prefix is the `containers/` sub-folder to release**.

| Tag | What it releases |
|---|---|
| `bricks/X.Y.Z` | everything in `containers/bricks/` (`python-apps-base`, `models-downloader`) + Python `.whl` uploaded to GitHub Release |
| `ai/X.Y.Z` | everything in `containers/ai/` (the model runners) |

Release cycles for AI containers and Bricks are independent — they use separate folders and tag prefixes,
and can be released at any time without affecting each other.

After releasing a new version of AI containers, compose files that use AI containers are updated automatically via a generated PR.

**Dependencies**: base images in `containers/base/` are not released on their own. Whatever a tagged
group depends on is rebuilt first, in dependency order, and tagged with the same version — releasing
`bricks/X.Y.Z` builds `python-slim` and `python-base` before `python-apps-base`. No manual step required.

For development, the dev build pipeline (`docker-build.yml`) is triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) on a branch and builds the selected containers (or all of them), tagging the images as `dev-<branch-name>`. Dependent containers are built in the correct order — downstream containers wait for their upstream to finish and use the freshly built image.

See [`.github/README.md`](.github/README.md) for full CI documentation.

### Container layers

Library containers are based on a set of pre-defined Python base images, in `containers/base/`, that are
updated with a different frequency wrt library release.
Base images are never released on their own: they are rebuilt as a dependency of whichever group is being
released, and tagged with that release version.

Base images are required to:
* reduce the amount of updated layers during a single library update
* promote reuse of existing layers in multiple builds
* cache pre-compiled python libraries as much as possible

Non-base images should start from common base images for performance and disk usage needs.

## License
See [LICENSE](./LICENSE.txt) file for details.

## Dependencies
Every Python package the library and the containers install is pinned with hashes in a `uv.lock` next to its `pyproject.toml`: the repository root for the library, each container directory for the images (see [containers/README.md](containers/README.md#anatomy-of-a-container-directory)). The Dockerfiles install from the lock and refuse anything else, so an image is reproducible from its commit. After editing a `pyproject.toml` run `task deps:lock` to refresh the locks, `task deps:lock -- --upgrade` moves them to newer versions, and Dependabot opens weekly upgrade pull requests on which the license scan and the container builds run.

## Dependency licenses
`task license:deps` checks the licenses of the Python packages shipped by the library and by every container, using Docker. Records live under `.licenses/`, the allowed licenses and reviewed packages in `.licensed.yml`. See [scripts/licensed/README.md](scripts/licensed/README.md) for how it works and what to do when it fails.

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
SBOMs are not kept in the tree. Each `bricks/X.Y.Z` release attaches `sboms.zip` to the GitHub Release, with one folder per distributed image holding three SPDX documents:

- `base.spdx.json` — packages of the base image the container derives `FROM` (declared as `sbom.runtime_base` in the container's `ci.json`)
- `full.spdx.json` — complete package list of the container image
- `delta.spdx.json` — packages added by the container on top of its base image

See [containers/README.md](containers/README.md#sboms) for how the set of images is resolved. To generate delta SBOMs locally, run:
```sh
task sbom:delta
```
optionally passing container names and the image tag to scan, e.g.:
```sh
task sbom:delta -- python-apps-base --version 1.0.0
```

**Note**: To run this task, you need `syft` installed and access to the container registry.
