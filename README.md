# Arduino Apps Brick Library

Library is composed by configurable and reusable 'Bricks', based on optional infrastructure (executed via Docker Compose) and wrapping Python® code (to simplify code usage). 

## What is a Brick?

A **Brick** is a modular, reusable building block that provides specific functionality for Arduino applications. Each Brick is self-contained with standardized configuration, consistent APIs, and optional Docker service definitions.

## Directory Structure

Every Brick must follow this standardized directory structure:

```
src/arduino/app_bricks/brick_name/
├── __init__.py                 # Required: Public API exports
├── brick_config.yaml          # Required: Brick metadata
├── brick_compose.yaml         # Optional: Docker services
├── README.md                  # Required: Documentation
├── [implementation_files.py]  # Brick logic
└── [assets]                   # Static resources
```

Brick usage examples live in the [app-bricks-examples](https://github.com/arduino/app-bricks-examples) repository, under the `bricks/` folder.

## Configuration variables

| Variable  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| APP_HOME  | Base application directory context  |
| LOCAL_DEV | To switch logic for local library development |
| APPSLAB_VERSION | To override the image versions referenced in brick_compose.yaml files |

## Library compile and build 

To build wheel file suitable for release, use following commands:
```sh
pip install build
python -m build .
```
To build package as snapshot for latest development build, use following build command:
```sh
pip install build
python -m build --config-setting "build_type=dev" .
```

## Library development steps
To start the development, clone the repository and create a virtual environment.

Install the Taskfile CLI tool: https://taskfile.dev/installation/.

Then, run the following command to set up the development environment:

```sh
task init
```

This task will check the python version and install the required dependencies.

To force a specific Arduino App Lab container version, use 'APPSLAB_VERSION' environment variable.

## Linting and formatting

To improve the development experience in VS Code, we recommend adding a `.vscode` folder to the repository root containing the following JSON files:

- `extensions.json`

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "charliermarsh.ruff",
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github",
    "ms-python.python",
    "tamasfe.even-better-toml"
  ],
  "unwantedRecommendations": [
    "ms-python.pylint"
  ]
}
```

- `settings.json`

```json
{
    // Set the Python interpreter to the virtual environment
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv",
    "flake8.enabled": false,  // Disable flake8 since we use ruff
    "ruff.enable": true,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "tests"
    ],
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,

    // Linting and fromatting settings on save
    "[python]": {
        // 1) use ruff as the default formatter
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        
        // 2) automatically format the code on save
        // comment this setting if you don't want to automatically format your code on save
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,

        // 3) apply secure linter fixes on save
        // comment this setting if you don't want to automatically fix with the linter your code on save
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
        }
    }
}
```

After adding those files, VS Code will suggest installing the Python and Ruff extensions, which are properly configured for this project.

Alternatively, you can use the Ruff CLI to safely auto-fix linting issues and format your code by running:

```sh
task lint
```

```sh
task fmt
```

## Testing

All tests must be added in tests/ folder. To execute tests, run command:
```sh
task test
```

or, to execute specific tests, use:
```sh
task test:arduino/app_bricks
```

Modules can use LOCAL_DEV=true env variable to set development specific configurations.

For development purposes, it is possible to change docker registry path using variable:
```sh
DOCKER_REGISTRY_BASE=ghcr.io/arduino/
```
Containers built as part of this library are tagged `dev-<branch-name>` by the dev build pipeline and with a semver version number on release.
To use a specific version, override it via 'APPSLAB_VERSION' env variable.

## Release

Release is based on tags pushed to `main`. A single workflow (`docker-publish.yml`) handles all container releases and detects which containers to publish from the tag prefix, matched against the release groups in `docker-bake.hcl`.

| Tag | What it publishes |
|---|---|
| `release/X.Y.Z` | `python-apps-base` and `models-downloader` containers + Python `.whl` uploaded to GitHub Release |
| `ai/X.Y.Z` | The AI model runner containers (`ei-*`, `llamacpp-*`, `gesture-recognition-runner`) |

Release cycles for AI containers and Bricks are independent — they use separate tag prefixes and can be released at any time without affecting each other.

After a release, compose files referencing the released containers are updated automatically via a generated PR.

Only the distributed leaf containers are published. Intermediate base containers (`python-slim`, `python-base`, `qairt-common-base`, `aihub-models-runner`) are rebuilt in-graph as part of every build that needs them — `docker buildx bake` orders the builds through the parent links declared in `docker-bake.hcl` — and are never tagged.

For development, the dev build pipeline (`docker-build.yml`) is dispatched manually with a selection of containers and builds them, together with their parents and derived containers, under a branch-specific tag.

See [`.github/README.md`](.github/README.md) for full CI documentation.

### Container layers

Library containers are structured over shared intermediate base images (run `task containers:tree` to print the hierarchy), which are updated with a different frequency wrt library releases and cached across builds.

Intermediate base images are required to:
* reduce the amount of updated layers during a single library update
* promote reuse of existing layers in multiple builds
* cache pre-compiled python libraries as much as possible

Non-base images should start from common base images for performance and disk usage needs.

## License
See [LICENSE](./LICENSE.txt) file for details.

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
Each container includes an SBOM file listing all installed packages, their versions, and licenses:

- `containers/ei-models-runner/sbom.spdx.json`
- `containers/python-apps-base/sbom.spdx.json`

Each SBOM file is generated in SPDX format, which is a standard format for SBOMs.

To generate SBOM files, run:
```sh
task sbom EI_TAG= BRICKS_TAG=
```
where `EI_TAG` and `BRICKS_TAG` represent the versions of the `ei-models-runner` and `python-apps-base` containers, 
respectively.

Example:
```sh
task sbom EI_TAG=1.0.0 BRICKS_TAG=1.0.0
```

**Note**: To run this task, you need to have Docker installed and running on your machine 
and the Docker sbom plugin installed.
